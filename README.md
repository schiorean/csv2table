A flexible command line tool to import a CSV file into a database table.

Currently the only supported database is MySql.

## TODO
1. Dates and numbers column mapping
1. Add tests
1. Performance comparision with PHP script
1. Performance improvements (goroutines for reading from csv and writing to db?)

## For the future
1. Email notifications when import is done, or failed
